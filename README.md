# PROJECT: Personal Blog Website

This is the first project of the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011)

The main objective is to use HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, files are appropriately structured, as well as the use of proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

## Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bolah2009/covid19-nigeria.git

```

- Install Dependencies (For linter)

```bash
yarn install
```

To run Stylelint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
yarn lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

and to have it actually fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
yarn format
```
